/**
 * Given a non-empty array of integers arr, create a function that returns the index of a peak element. We consider an
 * element as peak if it's greater than or equal to its neighbors, the next and previous element (assume that arr[-1]
 * and arr[n] are equal to -âˆž). And if there are multiple peaks in arr, just return the index of one of them.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: arr = [4, 5, 8, 3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: arr[2] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[1], and greater than or equal to arr[3]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: arr = [1, 3, 4, 7, 8]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: arr[4] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[3], which is it's only neighbor
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: arr = [1, 5, 2, 6, 6, 3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: arr[3] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[2] and greater than or equal to
 * arr[4] (other valid outputs would be 1 and 4, because arr[1] and arr[4] are also peak elements)
